# Flutter Designs

These are some designs to use with Flutter, they are not full functional, they are just styles and designs to use in future real projects.

## Getting Started

This Project is based on an example made by Fernando Herrera in this course (https://fernando-herrera.com/#/curso/flutter), however the version in this repo is different from the one it is based, the code is structured differently and have some new improvements made by myself.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
